    summary: "In React, simple shared state can be passed down via props—perfect for small apps with shallow component hierarchies. But as your app grows, props often become cumbersome when passed through several layers purely to reach deep components, resulting in messy code and maintenance challenges. React’s Context API alleviates this \"prop drilling\" by allowing you to store data in a provider that multiple components can access without passing props manually. While Context avoids unnecessary prop forwarding, it comes with caveats—like potential performance hits due to unintended re-renders and increased complexity in testing. For clean and scalable React architecture, use props for local state and Context for broader, deeper sharing"

    summary: "Prop drilling in React occurs when parent components pass state through several layers to reach deeply nested children—workable for small apps but quickly becomes unmanageable as your component tree grows. The Context API offers a more scalable solution by allowing state to be accessed by components at any depth, eliminating the need to thread props through intermediate layers. This approach simplifies maintenance and enhances readability, though it introduces additional abstractions. The article recommends using prop drilling for small, contained components where direct data passing is clear and intentional, and resorting to Context for complex or shared state across independent component branches. Knowing when to apply each approach helps you build cleaner, more maintainable React apps."

    summary: "Prop drilling refers to the practice of passing state through multiple layers of React components—even when intermediary components don’t use that state—creating unnecessary coupling and clutter. The article highlights why this pattern becomes problematic: it complicates maintenance, hampers readability, and reduces component reusability. The recommended remedy is using React’s Context API, which allows you to create a state provider accessible by components anywhere in the tree without manual prop passing. This approach streamlines data flow and simplifies refactoring in large applications. With Context in place, developers can avoid the spaghetti of nested props and write cleaner, more scalable React code."
